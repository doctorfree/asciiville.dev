## Asciiville Features

Asciiville integrations and extensions are aimed at the character
based terminal and console user. They enable easy to use seamlessly
integrated control of a variety of ASCII Art, animation, and utilities
in a lightweight character based environment.

At the core of Asciiville is the `asciiville` command which acts as
a front-end for a variety of terminal commands and `tmux` sessions.

### The asciiville Command

The `asciiville` command can be used to display Ascii Art either
as a slideshow or interactively. For example:

```console
# Slideshow of Ascii Art in /usr/share/asciiville/art/Art/
asciiville -V Art
# Slideshow of Ascii Art in /usr/share/asciiville/art/Vintage/
asciiville -V Vintage
# Interactive display of Ascii Art in .../file1 and .../file2
asciiville file1 file2 ...
# Slideshow of Ascii Art in file1, file2, and file3
asciiville -V files file1 file2 file3
# Slideshow of Ascii Art files listed in /tmp/asciiart.txt
asciiville -V files=/tmp/asciiart.txt
```

Filenames provided to `asciiville`, either on the command line or in
a specified file, can be absolute paths to files; relative paths to files;
or relative paths to files in the Asciiville Ascii Art galleries folder.
Ascii Art filenames may be provided with or without the filename suffix
(e.g. `Friends/tux.asc` or `Friends/tux.asc.gz` or `Friends/tux`).

When viewing Ascii Art in display mode it is possible to enter 'browse/zoom'
mode by entering 'b' or 'z' at the keyboard. In this mode the currently
displayed art can be zoomed in and out.

For greater detail see the [documentation](https://asciiville.dev/documentation).
