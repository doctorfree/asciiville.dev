Asciiville is where you go for ASCII Art, animations, and utilities.
The Asciiville project provides integration and extension of several
packages as well as providing convenience commands to invoke a variety
of components used to display ASCII Art, animations, and text based
utilities to perform common operations in a text-only environment.

Asciiville includes nearly 1,000 works of ASCII and ANSI Art!

Asciiville is one of the [Neoman](https://neoman.dev) managed projects:

Asciiville integrations and extensions are aimed at the character
based terminal and console user. They enable easy to use seamlessly
integrated control of a variety of ASCII Art, animation, and utilities
in a lightweight character based environment.

At the core of Asciiville is the `asciiville` command which acts as
a front-end for a variety of terminal commands and `tmux` sessions.

The `asciiville` command can be used to display Ascii Art either
as a slideshow or interactively.
