Asciiville includes many tools for generating and viewing ASCII Art
in a variety of ways including automatic conversion of images in any
image format into ASCII Art, slideshows of ASCII Art, and ASCII Art
animations. However, Asciiville does not yet provide a very rich set
of tools to generate ASCII Art other than the conversion of images.
The `tdraw` ASCII drawing tool is included but it is fairly primitive.
Also included in Asciiville, asciimatics and figlet can be used to
generate a wide variety of ASCII and ANSI art and text.

Additional drawing and painting tools for ASCII Art generation may be
desired. Future releases of Asciiville may include some of these.

Here is a short list of some of the ASCII Art drawing and paint tools
available but not included in Asciiville. The list is short because
there are just not that many available. Or, I have not found them yet.
Let us know which ASCII Art tools you think we should include.

## [PabloDraw](https://github.com/blocktronics/pablodraw)

PabloDraw is an Ansi/Ascii text and RIPscrip vector graphic art
editor/viewer with multi-user capabilities.

## [Moebius](https://github.com/blocktronics/moebius)

Moebius is an ANSI Editor for MacOS, Linux and Windows. The major feature
that differentiates it from PabloDraw is the 'half-block' brush which allows
editing in a style closer to Photoshop than a text editor, although you can
still use the function and cursor keys to draw with, and you should find that
most of the text editing features from PabloDraw are carried over to this
editor. The editor is still a work in progress.

## [Scribble](http://buttersquid.ink/scribble.html)

Scribble is an ASCII art editor which lets you draw vector diagrams and render
them into ASCII art. The original vector objects are converted into a short
(well, short-ish) URL and string, appended to the bottom of the diagram.
Paste both the ASCII art and URL into your source code or README file.
If you need to modify the ASCII art later, you can regenerate the original
vector shapes in Scribble by using the URL.

## [LSD (LSDeluxe)](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)

This project is a rewrite of GNU ls with lot of added features like colors,
icons, tree-view, more formatting options etc. LSD is included here not because
it is a drawing or paint tool but because it is really cool and includes
the ability to decorate files and directories and symbolic links and devices
with ASCII representations of icons using
[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

## [arttime](https://github.com/reportaman/arttime)

ARttime provides curated text-art with an alarm, timer, and notifications.

## [ascii-image-converter](https://github.com/TheZoraiz/ascii-image-converter)

Asciiville includes the _jp2a_ image to ascii conversion utility. However, there
are several other such converters, each with its own merits. One good digital
image to ascii art conversion tool is `ascii-image-converter`.

## [artem](https://github.com/FineFindus/artem)

Artem is a command line tool to convert images to ascii art, similar to
Asciiville's `jp2a`.

More to come ...
